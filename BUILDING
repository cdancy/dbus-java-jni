In case of build errors on Windows, e.g. in a Cygwin environment, edit file

<path-to-JDK>/include/win32/jni_md.h

and change the following block

typedef long jint;
typedef __int64 jlong;
typedef signed char jbyte;

to

typedef long jint;
#ifdef __GNUC__
typedef long long jlong;
#else
typedef __int64 jlong;
#endif
typedef signed char jbyte;
